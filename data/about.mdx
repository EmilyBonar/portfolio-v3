I graduated from [**Rice University**](https://www.rice.edu/) in 2018 with a
degree in Materials Science and Nanoengineering and a specialization in **3D Printing**.
Since then I've switched focus to **Front-End Development** and making websites
(like this one!).

The first piece of programming I can remember was making a calulator in
**Python** in 7th grade to help with math homework. Since then, I've been
solving problems using **MATLAB**, **LabVIEW**, and more recently, making things
using tools like **React**, **TailwindCSS**, and **TypeScript**. I finished a
batch at the [**Recurse Center**](https://www.recurse.com/) where I honed my web
development skills, and am currently working remotely as a **Front-End Developer**
at **HPE**.

Outside of tech, my interests involve reading, cooking, baking, and games of all
types.
