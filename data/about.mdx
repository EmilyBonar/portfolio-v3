I graduated from [**Rice University**](https://www.rice.edu/) with an engineering
degree and a specialization in **3D Printing**, but quickly discovered that the work wasn't for me.
Since then I've switched focus to **Front-End Development** and making websites
(like this one!).

I've been writing code to solve problems for over 15 years now, ever since I was
writing calculators in **Python** to help with my middle school math homework.
Since then the problems have gotten more complicated, but the process is the same.
I've worked in **MATLAB**, **LabVIEW**, and more recently, making things
using tools like **React**, **TailwindCSS**, and **TypeScript**. I'm an alum of
the [**Recurse Center**](https://www.recurse.com/), where I honed my web
development skills, and that experience helped me get a job as a **Front-End Developer**.
I worked there for almost 4 years until my entire business unit was laid off at the end of 2024,
so I'm currently open for new opportunities.

Outside of tech, my interests involve reading, cooking, baking, and games of all
types.
